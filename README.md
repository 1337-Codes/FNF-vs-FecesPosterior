# FNF-vs-FecesPosterior
V5 moment! Using an engine instead of a template mod! (Mag Engine)
I switched to using this engine for the following reasons:
  easy to mod with (no coding required)
  using a template mod gives your mod unoriginal features
  week 7 moment LEZAGO
Now to enable ghost tapping change the preference option from old to new input. (don't ask me ask magnumsrt)
